This Shiny Application combine multiple HRV or BRS report files from `.txt` to a cleaned Excel file (one row per subject).

-   **HRV:** expect input from LabChart's HRV Report files.

Functions used to combine HRV report came from package [{physiolab}](https://github.com/Lightbridge-AI/physiolab).
